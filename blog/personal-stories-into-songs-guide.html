                            <h3>Choose Your Core Story</h3>
                            <p>Start by identifying the main story you want to tell. Focus on one central narrative rather than trying to include everything. Ask yourself:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>What moment or relationship is most important to capture?</li>
                                <li>What emotion do I want this song to convey?</li>
                                <li>Who is this song for, and what would mean most to them?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The best songs often focus on a single, powerful story rather than a broad overview of multiple events.</p>
                        </div>
