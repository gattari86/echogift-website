                <h2>Why Mom's Story Deserves More Than Flowers</h2>
                
                <h3>Flowers Wilt, Stories Live Forever</h3>
                <p>The average Mother's Day bouquet costs $75 and lasts one week. A custom song about mom's life costs $49.99 and lasts forever. Which better honors the woman who gave you everything?</p>
                
                <h3>Generic Gifts vs. Personal Legacy</h3>
                <p>Anyone can buy flowers, chocolates, or jewelry from a store. But capturing mom's unique story, her specific sacrifices, her individual wisdom? That takes thought, love, and creates something no one else will ever have.</p>
                
                <h3>The Gift That Keeps Giving</h3>
                <p>A personalized song about mom becomes a family treasure. Play it at family gatherings, share it with siblings, pass it down to grandchildren. It becomes part of the family story forever.</p>
                
                <h3>What Mom Actually Wants</h3>
                <p>Research shows 82% of moms prefer quality time over expensive gifts. A custom song gives her both - the quality time you spent reflecting on her life, and a permanent reminder that her story matters.</p>

                <h3>Her Unique Phrases</h3>
                <p>Every mom has sayings that shaped you: "This too shall pass," "Kill them with kindness," "Family first always." Include these in her song for instant emotional connection.</p>
                
                <h3>Specific Memories</h3>
                <p>Not just "mom was caring" but "the way you stayed up all night when I had pneumonia" or "how you drove to three stores to find my favorite birthday cake flavor."</p>
                
                <h3>Her Personal Journey</h3>
                <p>Where she came from, challenges she overcame, dreams she achieved or deferred, the woman she became while raising you.</p>
                
                <h3>Her Lasting Impact</h3>
                <p>How her love shaped who you are today, lessons you're passing to your own children, the legacy she's creating through her family.</p>
