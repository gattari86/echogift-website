                <h2>When Traditional Supplies Aren't Enough</h2>
                <p>With 72% of parents making financial sacrifices for back-to-school shopping and 65% struggling with rising costs, families are finding creative ways to support their students. While notebooks and backpacks are essential, emotional support and confidence-building are equally important for academic success.</p>
                
                <p>A custom motivational song costs less than a single pair of school shoes but provides emotional support that lasts the entire academic year. It's an investment in your student's mental health, self-confidence, and resilience - qualities that matter as much as any supply on their school list.</p>
