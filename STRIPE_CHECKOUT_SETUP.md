## ðŸš¨ Next Step: Create Products in Stripe

You need to create two products in your Stripe Dashboard and get their Price IDs.

### Step 1: Create Products

1. Go to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)
2. Click **"+ Add product"**

**Product 1: Personalized Song**
- Name: `Personalized Song`
- Description: `Custom AI-generated song with your story`
- Price: `$79.00 USD`
- Billing: `One time`
- Click **"Save product"**
- Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)

**Product 2: Custom Song Album**
- Name: `Custom Song Album` 
- Description: `3-5 personalized songs telling your complete story`
- Price: `$299.00 USD`
- Billing: `One time`
- Click **"Save product"**
- Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)

### Step 2: Update Your Website Code

Once you have your Price IDs, I need to update the `checkout.js` file:

1. Replace `price_1234567890abcdef` with your $79 song Price ID
2. Replace `price_0987654321fedcba` with your $299 album Price ID

**Send me your two Price IDs and I'll update the code for you!**
