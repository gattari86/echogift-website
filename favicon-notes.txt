FAVICON SETUP NEEDED:

To complete the SEO setup, you need to add these image files:

1. favicon.ico (32x32 pixels) - The website icon that appears in browser tabs
   - Should be a simple EchoGift logo with music note or gift theme
   - Place at root: /favicon.ico

2. apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 pixels) - Icon for iOS devices
   - Should be the same EchoGift logo optimized for mobile
   - Place at root: /apple-touch-icon.png

3. Open Graph image optimization:
   - The existing artwork images are already set up for social sharing
   - Consider creating a dedicated OG image (1200x630) with EchoGift branding

These files are referenced in the HTML but need to be created and uploaded.
